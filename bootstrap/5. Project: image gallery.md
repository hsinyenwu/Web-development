** get hi-resolution stock images from a website called unsplash **

If you find an image you like then you'll need to click on the image to make it full screen at which point the url will change to give you the photo's ID. 
It's the alphanumeric combination that comes after ?photo=.

Once you copy the photo's ID then you can add it to the source.unsplash address like so:
