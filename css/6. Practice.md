  <p>The oldest documented forms of art are visual arts, which include creation of images or objects in fields including painting, sculpture, printmaking, photography, and other visual media. <em>Architecture is often included as one of the visual arts;</em> however, like the decorative arts, or advertising, it involves the creation of objects where the practical considerations of use are essentialâ€”in a way that they usually are not in a painting, for example. Music, theatre, film, dance, and other performing arts, as well as literature and other media such as interactive media, are included in a broader definition of art or the arts.</p>

  <p>I'm the second paragraph inside this div!</p>

<p>PARAGRAPH NOT INSIDE A DIV</p>


<div>
  <h2>A less awesome h2</h2>

  <p>Until the 17th century, art referred to any skill or mastery and was not differentiated from crafts or sciences. In modern usage after the 17th century, where aesthetic considerations are paramount, the fine arts are separated and distinguished from acquired skills in general, such as the decorative or applied arts.</p>

  <p>One last paragraph here!</p>

  <br>

  <input type="text" name="name" /><label> Name</label><br/>
  <input type="password" name="password" /><label> Password</label><br/>
