## Add background
Set the background color to yellow with *body{background:yellow;}*

```css
h1 {
	color:red;
}
li {
	color: rgb(0,0,200);
}
h2 {
	color:rgba(200,200,200,0.7);
}
h3 {
	color: #FF0007;
}
/*make the background yellow*/
body {
	background: yellow;
}
```

Set background to an image:
For example:
```css
body {
	background: url(https://images3.alphacoders.com/157/157205.jpg);
	/*The next one is a gif file of frogs, the background keep changing*/
	/*background: url(http://kids.nationalgeographic.com/content/dam/kids/photos/articles/Nature/H-P/kermit-frog2.gif);*/
}
```
If the image was too big, add *background-size: cover;*
```css
body {
	background: url(https://images3.alphacoders.com/157/157205.jpg);
	background-size: cover;
}
```
If the image was too small, but still do not want it to repeat,add *background-repeat: no-repeat;*
The image will only be shown once.
```css
body {
	background: url(https://images3.alphacoders.com/157/157205.jpg);
	background-repeat: no-repeat;
}
```
If the image was too small. You do not want it to repeat, but want it to fit the page: add *background-size: cover;*
```css
body {
	background: url(https://images3.alphacoders.com/157/157205.jpg);
	background-repeat: no-repeat;
	background-size: cover;
}
```

## Add border to text
Three components for a border:
1. width: 1px ... 10px ... 
2. color: blue, yellow, pink,...
3. style: solid, dashed, dotted

For example, add border to the h1 tag:
```css
h1 {
	color:red;
	/*You can write 3 components separately*/
	border-color: blue;
	border-width: 3px;
	border-style: dotted;
}
```

Shortcut to write three components together:
```css
h1 {
	color:red;
	
/*You can also write 3 components together*/
	border: 5px pink solid;
	/*You can also change the sequence like: border: pink solid 5px;*/
}
```
